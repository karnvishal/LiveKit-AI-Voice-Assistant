## 🧠 AI Technology Explained 

### Core AI Components

**1. Speech-to-Text (STT) - "AI Ears"**
- Converts customer's spoken words into text that the computer can understand
- Like having a highly accurate transcriptionist that works instantly
- Uses OpenAI's Whisper technology for industry-leading accuracy

**2. Large Language Model (LLM) - "AI Brain"**
- The intelligent reasoning component that understands context and generates responses
- Similar to ChatGPT but specialized for customer service
- Uses GPT-4 Turbo for advanced conversation capabilities

**3. Text-to-Speech (TTS) - "AI Voice"**
- Converts the AI's text responses back into natural-sounding speech
- Creates human-like voice interactions
- Uses OpenAI's advanced voice synthesis technology

**4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - "AI Memory"**
- Acts as the AI's knowledge base and memory system
- Searches through company documents and information to find relevant answers
- Ensures responses are accurate and based on actual business information
- Like having an instant search through all company manuals and FAQs

### How RAG Works
1. **Knowledge Preparation**: Company documents (PDFs, web pages) are processed and stored
2. **Smart Search**: When a customer asks a question, the system searches for relevant information
3. **Context Integration**: Found information is combined with the customer's question
4. **Intelligent Response**: The AI generates an answer using both the question and relevant company knowledge

## 🔄 Data Flow Process

### 1. Knowledge Base Preparation
1. **Document Ingestion**: PDF documents placed in `raw_data_rag/`
2. **Text Extraction**: `scrape_docs.py` processes PDFs and extracts formatted text
3. **Chunking**: Text divided into semantic paragraphs for optimal retrieval
4. **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk converted to 1536-dimensional vectors
5. **Index Building**: Annoy index created for fast similarity search

### 2. Real-time Conversation Flow
1. **Audio Capture**: Customer speaks, audio captured via LiveKit
2. **Speech Recognition**: Whisper converts speech to text
3. **Query Processing**: Customer question analyzed for intent
4. **Knowledge Retrieval**: RAG system searches for relevant information
5. **Response Generation**: GPT-4 combines query with retrieved context
6. **Voice Synthesis**: Response converted to natural speech
7. **Audio Delivery**: Synthesized voice played to customer

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Duplicate result filtering prevents repetitive responses
- Context ranking ensures most relevant information priority
- Fallback handling for queries without matching knowledge
